{{< columns >}}
## What are tech pants?

Tech pants are a new, mostly men-centric, trend coming from the silicon valley and taking over the world. 
Men are known to be less targetted by fashion, and to spend more money on durable and comfortable clothing. 
Tech pants are the merging of these two trends: fashion and dressed pants that also feel comfortable due to their yoga-like textile.
